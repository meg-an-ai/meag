The goal of treating mpox is to take care of the rash, manage pain and prevent complications. Early and supportive care is important to help manage symptoms and avoid further problems. 
    </p>
<p>Getting an mpox vaccine can help prevent infection (pre-exposure prophylaxis). It is recommended for people at high-risk of getting mpox, especially during an outbreak.
</p>
<p>Groups that may be at high risk of mpox include: 
</p>
<ul>
    <li> health and care workers at risk of exposure;</li>
    <li> people in the same household or close community as someone who has mpox, including children;</li>
    <li> people who have multiple sex partners, including men who have sex with men; and</li>
    <li> sex workers of any gender and their clients.</li>
</ul>
<p> The vaccine can also be administered after a person has been in contact with someone who has mpox (post-exposure prophylaxis). In these cases, the vaccine should be given less than 4 days after contact with someone who has mpox. The vaccine can be given for up to 14 days if the person has not developed symptoms. </p>
    <p> Some antivirals have received emergency use authorization in some countries and are being evaluated in clinical trials. To date, there is no proven effective antiviral treatment for mpox. It is a priority to continue evaluation of therapeutics in robust clinical trials and to focus on optimizing supportive care for patients.</p>
<p>More research is needed on how mpox spreads during outbreaks in different settings and under different conditions.</p>
