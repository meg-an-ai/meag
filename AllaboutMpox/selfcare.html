Most people with mpox will recover within 2â€“4 weeks. Things to do to help the symptoms and prevent transmitting mpox to others: 
    </p>
<p>Do</p>
<ul>
    <li>ontact your health care provider for advice;</li>
    <li>stay at home and in your own, well-ventilated room if possible; </li>
    <li>wash hands often with soap and water or hand sanitizer, especially before or after touching sores; </li>
    <li>wear a mask and cover lesions when around other people until your rash heals; </li>
    <li>keep skin dry and uncovered (unless in a room with someone else); </li>
    <li>avoid touching items in shared spaces and disinfect shared spaces frequently;  </li>
    <li>use saltwater rinses for sores in the mouth; </li>
    <li>take warm baths with baking soda or Epsom salts for body sores; and </li>
    <li>take ovor-the-counter medications for pain like paracetamol (acetaminophen) or ibuprofen. </li>
</ul>
<p>Do not </p>
<ul>
    <li>pop blisters or scratch sores, which can slow healing, spread the rash to other parts of the body, and cause sores to become infected; or </li>
    <li>shave areas with sores until scabs have healed and you have new skin underneath (this can spread the rash to other parts of the body). </li>
    </ul>
<p> To prevent spread of mpox to others, people with mpox should isolate at home following guidance from their health care provider, or in hospital if needed, for the duration of the infectious period (from onset of symptoms until lesions have healed and scabs fall off). Covering lesions and wearing a well-fitting mask when in the presence of others may help prevent spread. Using condoms during sex will help reduce the risk of getting mpox but will not prevent spread from skin-to-skin or mouth-to-skin contact. If having sex, use condoms as a precaution for 12 weeks (about 3 months) after you have recovered. </p>
<p>Taking a break from sexual activity with new partners during periods of increased transmission can reduce the risk of getting mpox. Those who have had contact with someone with mpox should monitor for signs and symptoms for 21 days (3 weeks) and take precautions such as avoiding sexual activity during this period.</p>
<p>Health workers should follow infection prevention and control measures to protect themselves while caring for patients with mpox by wearing appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) (i.e. gloves, gown, eye protection and respirator) and adhering to protocol for safely swabbing lesions for diagnostic testing and handling sharp objects such as needles.</p>
