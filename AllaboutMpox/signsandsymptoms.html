Mpox causes signs and symptoms which usually begin within a week but can start 1–21 days after exposure. Symptoms typically last 2–4 weeks but may last longer in someone with a weakened immune system. 
    </p>
<p>Common symptoms of mpox are: 
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li> rash</li>
<li> fever</li>
<li> sore throat</li>
<li> headache</li>
<li> muscle aches</li>
<li> back pain</li>
<li> low energy</li>
<li> swollen lymp nodes</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>For some people, the first symptom of mpox is a rash, while others may have fever, muscle aches or sore throat first.  </p>
<p>The mpox rash often begins on the face and spreads over the body, extending to the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. It can also start on other parts of the body where contact was made, such as the genitals. It starts as a flat sore, which develops into a blister filled with liquid that may be itchy or painful. As the rash heals, the lesions dry up, crust over and fall off. </p>
<p>Some people may have one or a few skin lesions and others have hundreds or more. These can appear anywhere on the body including: </p>
<p>
<ul>
<li> palms of hands and soles of feet</li>
<li> face, mouth and throat</li>
<li> groin and genital areas</li>
<li> anus</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Some people also have painful swelling of their rectum (proctitis) or pain and difficulty when peeing (dysuria) or when swallowing. </p>
<p>People with mpox can pass the disease on to others until all sores have healed and a new layer of skin has formed. Some people can be infected without developing any symptoms. Although getting mpox from someone who is asymptomatic (not showing symptoms) has been reported, information is still limited on how common it is.  </p>
<p>Children, pregnant people and people with weak immune systems, including people living with HIV that is not well controlled, are at higher risk for serious illness and death due to complications from mpox. </p>
<p>Some people with mpox become very sick. For example, the skin can become infected with bacteria, leading to abscesses or serious skin damage. Other complications include pneumonia; corneal infection with loss of vision; pain or difficulty swallowing; vomiting and diarrhoea causing dehydration or malnutrition; and infections of the blood (sepsis), brain (encephalitis), heart (myocarditis), rectum (proctitis), genital organs (balanitis) or urinary passages (urethritis). Mpox can be fatal in some cases.  </p>
